Title: Metabarcoding Analysis using Modeled Bayesian Occurrences
Description: A program to analyze eDNA metabarcoding sequence data from 
  multiple trophic levels to identify drivers and patterns of biodiversity 
  in marine ecosystems. The input data are two metabarcoding data sets 
  generated from two different marker genes targeting different trophic 
  levels from the same eDNA sample. Analysis has three stages: 
  1) modeling sequence read counts as a beta distribution and using 
  random draws from this distrubition to generate principal component analyses, 
  2) applying a Bayesian model to identify correlations between two different 
  data sets, and 
  3) extracting the features (ASVs) with the greatest effect on the correlations. 
  Created for the 2023 NOAA/NCAR Hackathon, part of the Open Hackathons program.
