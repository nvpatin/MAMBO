# MarineDNA
A program to analyze eDNA metabarcoding sequence data from multiple trophic levels to identify drivers and patterns of biodiversity 
in marine ecosystems. Created for the 2023 NOAA-NCAR Hackathon for development and optimization. Analysis has two stages: 1) 
modeling sequence read counts as a probability function and using the transformed data to extract principal components and cluster 
samples, and 2) applying a Bayesian linear regression to amplicon data sets from two different marker genes to identify 
correlations between trophic levels.
